== Introduction
Since Hot Rod is a binary, language neutral, protocol an Infinispan client can use any programming 
language to interact with Java based Infinispan Hot Rod server as long as client APIs exist for that 
particular client runtime. C\++ Hot Rod client allows C++ runtime applications to connect and interact 
with an Infinispan Hot Rod server. 


== Installation
=== Pre-requisites
We provide HotRod C\++ client in two library formats: static and shared/dynamic. Depending on user's 
preference and deployment scenario one would usually choose static library to ensure that the version 
of the Hot Rod C++ library that application was compiled with would be the version of the library used 
at runtime. As it names implies static library is statically linked to an application thus increasing the 
size of the final executable. In other cases shared Hot Rod C\++ library might be more suitable. Shared 
libraries are usually stored and versioned separately. If an updated HotRod C++ library is considered 
binary compatible with the original version shipped along user's application an updated Hot Rod C++ 
library could be used in such a scenario without recompiling client application.

== Usage
=== Configuration

C++ clients would typically interact with a remote Hot Rod server using RemoteCache API. However, 
before any interaction is initiated one would have to configure RemoteCache to connect to a particular 
Hot Rod server and more importantly choose a specific cache on that Hot Rod server. This is where 
ConfigurationBuilder API comes in handy. ConfigurationBuilder allows users to not only specify 
particular Hot Rod server to interact with but a range of other configuration options through its 
intuitive fluent API. Users can configure specifics of the underlying connection pool, connection 
timeout, particular Hot Rod protocol version and so on. Refer to ConfigurationBuilder API 
documentation for more details.

For example, this simple C\++ main executable file below uses application paramaters in combination 
with ConfigurationBuilder API to configure a RemoteCacheManager instance and in turn RemoteCache 
instance interacting with a remote Hot Rod server. Note the most important C++ Hot Rod includes as 
well.

#include "infinispan/hotrod/ConfigurationBuilder.h"
#include "infinispan/hotrod/RemoteCacheManager.h"
#include "infinispan/hotrod/RemoteCache.h"

#include <stdlib.h>

using namespace infinispan::hotrod;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ConfigurationBuilder builder;
    builder.addServer().host(argc > 1 ? argv[1] : "127.0.0.1").port(argc > 2 ? atoi(argv[2]) : 11222);
    RemoteCacheManager cacheManager(builder.build(), false);
    RemoteCache<std::string, std::string> cache = cacheManager.getCache<std::string, std::string>();
    cacheManager.start();
    return 0;
}

=== API
As we have seen the main API revolves around ConfigurationBuilder for configuration of a RemoteCacheManager.
RemoteCacheManager is in turn a starting point for obtaining a reference to a RemoteCache. RemoteCache is 
in fact the main API for interaction with a remote Hot Rod server and the specific cache on that server. 

Continuing with a previous example from above, now that we have a RemoteCache reference one would simply 
start invocations on a cache, inserting, removing, getting, and replacing values in a cache, as well as 
others methods such as iterating key/value pairs, bulk get operations, clear method and so on.

After interaction with a remote server is completed all related client resources are reclaimed once 
RemoteCacheManager is stopped. 

[source, C/C++]
----
    ..
    RemoteCache<std::string, std::string> cache = cacheManager.getCache<std::string, std::string>();
    cacheManager.start();

    std::string k1("key13");   
    std::string v1("boron");

    // put
    cache.put(k1, v1);
    std::auto_ptr<std::string> rv(cache.get(k1));
    
    cache.putIfAbsent(k1, v1);
    std::auto_ptr<std::string> rv2(cache.get(k1));
    
    std::map<HR_SHARED_PTR<std::string>,HR_SHARED_PTR<std::string> > map = cache.getBulk(0);
    std::cout << "getBulk size" << map.size() << std::endl;
    ..
    .
    cacheManager.stop();
