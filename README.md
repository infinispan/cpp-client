# C++ Hot Rod Client #

C++ client for Infinispan, over the [Hot Rod] (https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ISPN/Hot+Rod+Protocol) wire protocol.
Released under Apache License, Version 2.0.

## Documentation
For more information, please refer to [the documentation of this client library](documentation/index.adoc).

## Build ##
Build prerequisites: 

    CMake 2.8 (2.6 may work except for swig subset)
    C++03 plus shared_ptr TR1 support.
    Infinispan server distribution (located via JBOSS_HOME or cmake directive)
    Java (any version compatible with the Infinispan distribution)
    Python 2.6 or newer
  
optional: SWIG, Doxygen

On Linux, use the package manager for your distribution to install the
necessary packages.  You may have to point to a special repository,
such as EPEL, to get CMake 2.8.

On Windows, Visual Studio 2008 + SP1, or any newer version, is
required.  You can obtain Windows installable distributions of other
needed software from:

    http://www.python.org/download/releases/
    http://www.swig.org/download.html
    http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
  

To build (where "srcdir" is the directory containg this README):

    os_make_directory my_build  [arbitrary location]
    cd my_build
    cmake [-DHOTROD_JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/ispn/dist] path/to/srcdir
    cmake --build .
    ctest [-V]

Platforms with makefiles and Valgrind may have additional targets:

    make test
    make memtest
    make memtestv

## Test with SWIG ##
The Java swig module is experimental and tested on Linux only.

Components needed to use swig tests: 
Apache Ant 1.8.x (http://ant.apache.org/), Apache Ivy 2.3.x (http://ant.apache.org/ivy/) and SWIG 2.0.x (http://www.swig.org/)

For building the JNI libraries and uncomment, in the top level CMakeLists.txt file, the line:

  #add_subdirectory(test/swig)
  
  build the project as described above.
  
  cd srcdir/test
  
  ant resolve
  
  cd srcdir
  
  ./sandbox/mkjar.sh

Use the run_jni.sh script in srcdir/jnitmp to run jni tests.
